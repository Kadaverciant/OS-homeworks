In order to increase the number of hits and reduce the number of misses,
you need to increase the number of requests to the same page so that there
are less than the number of frames allocated for the pages
elements between this two requests.
For ex. let's fix number of frames as 5:
for input data: 1 2 3 4 5 1 6 2
Hits = 1 Misses = 7
for input data: 1 2 3 4 5 1 6 2
Hits = 2 Misses = 6

For first input data hit was only for page with id = 1 since only for it
between 2 requests there were 4 others, which is less than a number of page frames.
At the same time for a page with id = 2 the number of requests for other pages
between 2 requests for it, were 5, which is a number of page frames.
For second input data, we mowed our second request to a page with id=2 on 1 position left
=> we achieved 2 hits since the situation between 2 requests for that page now is satisfying the condition.

Therefore, if we want to increase the number of misses we should put more
than a number of page frames requesters between requests for the same page.

Note: we do not consider pairs if between them there is a request for the same page, as for elements in pair.

For example for a situation where a number of page frames =5 and input 1 2 1 1 3 4
we will consider only 2 pairs:
(1,1) where first 1 that lies on 1st position and 1 on 3rd one,
(1,1) where first 1 lies on 3rd position and other on 4th one.
Note, we don't consider such pairs as pair (1,1)
where the first element lies in 1st position and the second one in 4th position
since between them there is a request for a page with id 1 on 3rd position.
